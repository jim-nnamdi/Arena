A minimal, educational **arena memory allocator** implemented in C, using a **linked-list-based structure** to support arbitrary allocations within fixed-size memory blocks. This project is great for learning custom memory management strategies, optimizing memory reuse, and understanding data locality.

## What is an Arena Allocator?

An **arena allocator** (also called a **region allocator**) is a fast memory allocation strategy that allocates memory from large pre-allocated blocks. It's especially useful when:

- You need fast and frequent allocations.
- You don't need to free individual allocationsâ€”just reset or free the entire arena.
- You're managing memory manually (e.g., in embedded systems, game engines, or custom interpreters).

This implementation supports:

- Chunked allocations from fixed-capacity blocks  
- Seamless allocation across linked arena nodes  
- Efficient mass reset and freeing  
- Simple debug print view
