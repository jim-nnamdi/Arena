A minimal, educational **arena memory allocator** implemented in C, using a **linked-list-based structure** to support arbitrary allocations within fixed-size memory blocks. This project is great for learning custom memory management strategies, optimizing memory reuse, and understanding data locality.

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ arena.c        # Arena allocator core logic
â”œâ”€â”€ arena.h        # Arena struct and function declarations
â”œâ”€â”€ main.c         # Example usage and testing
```
